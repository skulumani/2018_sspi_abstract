## 2017 SSPI Abstract

This is the abstract for my submission to the 2017 SSPI competition. 
Of course, the **School of Engineering** does not provide a proper [LaTeX source file](https://www.seas.gwu.edu/student-participant-information) so instead I'm using this which I created several years ago.

It's fairly close to what they desire and any differences are probably not going to be noticed.

This is an extension/modification of the version submitted for the R&D showcase.
